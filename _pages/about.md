# 👋 About Me

I am a second-year Master’s student at the School of Remote Sensing and Information Engineering, Wuhan University, under the supervision of Prof. [Jiayuan Li](https://ljy-rs.github.io/web/). My research focuses on key challenges in robotics, including SLAM, 3D reconstruction, pose estimation, and point cloud registration, with a particular emphasis on their applications in robotics.

I am always open to collaboration and discussion in these areas, so please don’t hesitate to [contact me](mailto:shaochengyan@whu.edu.cn) if you are interested.
